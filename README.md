# Greetings!

I'm The2ndSlimShady, a guy stuck with his old nickname from middle school because he's too lazy to find a new one!

I try to learn things all on my own, therefore I miserably fail trying but occasionally I manage to create something good and learn a little from it. The cycle continues!

I'm really interested in compilers, virtual machines and game engines. Hoping to make one of these one day! But currently all I create is utter garbage, worth it though.

## Public Projects:

- The first 'real' project I made: [SlimScript](https://github.com/The2ndSlimShady/SlimScript.git)
- A little [library](https://github.com/The2ndSlimShady/CLIParser.git) for handling command line input, for creating command line tools

## In Progress Projects to be Made Public Sometime in the Future:
- CSLB (Common Scripting Language Backend): 
	- An LLVM like backend for scripting languages, because why not? (won't be as heavy tho)
- JASM (Just an Assembly): 
	- A custom assembly language that mainly assembles into byte-code. (with the plans of native compilation using LLVM)
- CSR (Common Script Runtime): 
	- Runtime for JASM byte-code

## Dev Updates

Most Recent:  
- [JASM Fixes and CSR](https://github.com/The2ndSlimShady/The2ndSlimShady/blob/master/updates/JASM_Fixes_and_CSR.md) 

[See updates.md](https://github.com/The2ndSlimShady/The2ndSlimShady/blob/master/updates.md) for more
