# Greetings!

I'm Yusuf, a second-year to be Computer Engineering student, interested interested in graphics, game engines, compiler design and overall low-level topics. 
You can see the nickname The2ndSlimShady in some of my repositories, those are my old ones, back when I used that nickname instead of my own. I found the name
in middle school and used it ever since.

I try to learn things all on my own, therefore I miserably fail trying but occasionally I manage to create something good and learn a little from it. The cycle continues!

I'm really interested in compilers, virtual machines and game engines. Hoping to make one of these one day! But currently all I create is utter garbage, though it's worth it.

## Public Projects:

- The first 'real' project I made, from my early highschool years: [SlimScript](https://github.com/ysufender/SlimScript.git).
- A little [library](https://github.com/ysufender/CLIParser.git) for handling command line input, for creating command line tools.

## In Progress Projects to be Made Public Sometime in the Future:
- CSLB (Common Scripting Language Backend): 
	- An LLVM like backend for scripting languages, because why not?
- JASM (Just an Assembly): 
	- A custom assembly language that mainly assembles into byte-code. With the plans of native compilation using LLVM (maybe in far future).
- CSR (Common Script Runtime): 
	- Runtime for JASM byte-code

## Dev Updates

I occasionally write update readmes about what I'm currently doing. I use a script, written in [SlimScript](https://github.com/ysufender/SlimScript.git), to
semi-automate the process. It complicates things a little but I wanted to use the language for something useful, therefore proving that it is, although not so practical,
usable.

Most Recent:  
- [JASM 0.1.0 Is Out](https://github.com/ysufender/ysufender/blob/master/updates/JASM_0_1_0_Is_Out.md)
