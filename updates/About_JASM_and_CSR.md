### About JASM and CSR

I've recently finished the primal version of JASM assembler and linker. There are a couple
of instructions left to implement in the assembler and a couple of features for the linker
but overall it's ready for basic usage. So JASM can be considered finished at this point.

I'll start working on CSR soon but first I'll write a documentation for JASM I think.
