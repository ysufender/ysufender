### Current State of CSR

I started working on CSR like a week ago. I couldn't focus on it that much but the base
layer of it is pretty much clear in my head. I'm trying to create a solid skeleton to
build the whole project onto. Hopefully, if things go out as I'm planning, I might be
able to implement concurrency and even real threading into the VM.
